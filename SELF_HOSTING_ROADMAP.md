# GoLisp Self-Hosting Roadmap

## Current Status ✅

Your GoLisp implementation already has a strong foundation for self-hosting:

### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ Evaluator with 900+ lines of robust evaluation logic
- ✅ Macro system with `defmacro`, quasiquote/unquote  
- ✅ File loading system (`LoadFile`)
- ✅ REPL with parsing and evaluation
- ✅ Lexical environments with proper scoping
- ✅ Tail call optimization via loop/recur
- ✅ Bootstrap system extending kernel in Lisp

### Data Types & Special Forms
- ✅ Core data types: symbols, lists, vectors, hash-maps, sets
- ✅ Special forms: `if`, `def`, `fn`, `quote`, `do`, `defmacro`, `loop`, `recur`
- ✅ Arithmetic and comparison operators
- ✅ Collection operations (`first`, `rest`, `cons`, `conj`, etc.)

## Phase 1: Meta-Programming Core ✅

### Completed
- ✅ `eval` - Evaluate data as code
- ✅ `read-string` - Parse string into Lisp data  
- ✅ `slurp` - Read entire file as string
- ✅ `spit` - Write string to file
- ✅ `str` - String concatenation
- ✅ Type predicates: `symbol?`, `string?`, `keyword?`, `list?`, `vector?`
- ✅ Symbol manipulation: `symbol`, `keyword`, `name`
- ✅ `macroexpand` - Expand macros for inspection
- ✅ `gensym` - Generate unique symbols  
- ✅ `list*` - List construction with spread

### Still Needed
- [ ] Error handling improvements

## Phase 2: Enhanced Standard Library 📚

### String Operations
- [ ] `split` - Split strings by delimiter
- [ ] `join` - Join strings with separator  
- [ ] `substring` - Extract substrings
- [ ] `trim` - Remove whitespace
- [ ] `replace` - String replacement

### Collection Operations  
- [ ] `map` - Enhanced version with multiple collections
- [ ] `filter` - Filter by predicate
- [ ] `reduce` - Enhanced reduce (already have basic version)
- [ ] `apply` - Apply function to collection as arguments
- [ ] `sort` - Sort collections
- [ ] `group-by` - Group by key function

### I/O Operations
- [ ] `println` - Print with newline
- [ ] `prn` - Print for reading back
- [ ] File system operations (directory listing, etc.)

## Phase 3: Self-Hosting Compiler 🚀

### Core Compiler (Created in `lisp/self-hosting.lisp`)
- ✅ Basic compilation framework
- ✅ Special form compilation (`def`, `fn`, `if`, `quote`, `do`, `let`)
- ✅ Symbol table management
- ✅ Local variable tracking
- ✅ Function application compilation
- ✅ Vector compilation
- [ ] Macro expansion during compilation
- [ ] Improved multi-expression parsing (read-all)
- [ ] Optimization passes
- [ ] Error reporting with source locations

### Code Generation
- [ ] Generate optimized Lisp code
- [ ] Generate Go code (advanced)
- [ ] Generate bytecode (advanced)
- [ ] Dead code elimination
- [ ] Constant folding

### Compilation Pipeline
- [ ] Multi-file compilation
- [ ] Dependency resolution
- [ ] Module system
- [ ] Package management

## Phase 4: Advanced Self-Hosting 🎯

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Inline function calls
- [ ] Tail call optimization (beyond loop/recur)
- [ ] Constant propagation
- [ ] Type inference
- [ ] Memory optimization

### Development Tools
- [ ] Debugger written in GoLisp
- [ ] Profiler written in GoLisp
- [ ] Documentation generator
- [ ] Test framework
- [ ] Package manager

### Language Extensions
- [ ] Pattern matching
- [ ] Advanced destructuring
- [ ] Async/await constructs
- [ ] Exception handling
- [ ] Namespaces/modules

## Implementation Strategy 💡

### Step 1: Verify Meta-Programming Core
```bash
cd /home/leinonen/code/go-lisp
make build
./bin/golisp -e "(eval '(+ 1 2 3))"  # Should output 6
./bin/golisp -e "(symbol? 'hello)"   # Should output true
```

### Step 2: Test Self-Hosting Compiler
```bash
./bin/golisp -f lisp/self-hosting.lisp
# Then in REPL:
# (bootstrap-self-hosting)
```

### Step 3: Bootstrap Process
1. Load self-hosting compiler
2. Compile standard library with itself
3. Compile compiler with itself
4. Verify compiled versions work identically

### Step 4: Iterative Improvement
- Add missing functions as needed
- Improve compiler optimizations
- Expand standard library
- Add development tools

## Key Benefits of Self-Hosting 🌟

1. **Language Evolution**: Easy to add new features
2. **Bootstrapping**: Compiler improvements apply to itself
3. **Dogfooding**: Using the language to build itself
4. **Educational**: Demonstrates language capabilities
5. **Portability**: Easier to port to new platforms
6. **Optimization**: Self-optimizing compiler

## Next Immediate Steps 🎯

1. **✅ Phase 1 Complete - All meta-programming functions implemented**
2. **Add Phase 2 standard library functions (map, filter, apply, etc.)**
3. **Improve multi-expression parsing in self-hosting compiler**
4. **Test self-hosting compiler with realistic examples**
5. **Add macro expansion during compilation**

## Architecture Notes 🏗️

Your current architecture is excellent for self-hosting:
- Clean separation between kernel (Go) and library (Lisp)
- Robust macro system for code transformation
- File loading system for modular development
- REPL for interactive development
- Strong error handling and reporting

The foundation is solid - you're much closer to self-hosting than you might think!
