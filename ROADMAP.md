# GoLisp Self-Hosting Roadmap

## Current Status ✅

Your GoLisp implementation already has a strong foundation for self-hosting:

### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ Evaluator with 900+ lines of robust evaluation logic

- ✅ File loading system (`LoadFile`)
- ✅ REPL with parsing and evaluation
- ✅ Lexical environments with proper scoping
- ✅ Tail call optimization via loop/recur
- ✅ Bootstrap system extending kernel in Lisp

### Data Types & Special Forms
- ✅ Core data types: symbols, lists, vectors, hash-maps, sets
- ✅ Special forms: `if`, `def`, `fn`, `quote`, `do`, `defmacro`, `loop`, `recur`
- ✅ Arithmetic and comparison operators
- ✅ Collection operations (`first`, `rest`, `cons`, `conj`, etc.)

## Phase 1: Meta-Programming Core ✅

### Completed
- ✅ `eval` - Evaluate data as code
- ✅ `read-string` - Parse string into Lisp data  
- ✅ `slurp` - Read entire file as string
- ✅ `spit` - Write string to file

## Implementation Strategy 💡

### Step 1: Verify Meta-Programming Core
```bash
cd /home/leinonen/code/go-lisp
make build
./bin/golisp -e "(eval '(+ 1 2 3))"  # Should output 6
./bin/golisp -e "(symbol? 'hello)"   # Should output true
```

### Step 2: Test Self-Hosting Compiler
```bash
./bin/golisp -f lisp/self-hosting.lisp
# Then in REPL:
# (bootstrap-self-hosting)
```

### Step 3: Bootstrap Process
1. Load self-hosting compiler
2. Compile standard library with itself
3. Compile compiler with itself
4. Verify compiled versions work identically

### Step 4: Iterative Improvement
- Add missing functions as needed
- Improve compiler optimizations
- Expand standard library
- Add development tools

## Key Benefits of Self-Hosting 🌟

2. **Bootstrapping**: Compiler improvements apply to itself
3. **Dogfooding**: Using the language to build itself
4. **Educational**: Demonstrates language capabilities
5. **Portability**: Easier to port to new platforms
6. **Optimization**: Self-optimizing compiler

## Next Immediate Steps 🎯

3. **Improve multi-expression parsing in self-hosting compiler**
4. **Test self-hosting compiler with realistic examples**
5. **Add macro expansion during compilation**
