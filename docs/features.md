## Module System

The interpreter provides a comprehensive module system for organizing code into reusable namespaces with explicit exports and imports.

### Module Definition
```lisp
(module math-utils
  (export square cube add-squares)
  
  (defn square [x] (* x x))
  (defn cube [x] (* x x x))
  (defn add-squares [x y] (+ (square x) (square y)))
  
  ; Private helper function (not exported)
  (defn helper [x] (+ x 1)))
```

### Loading and Importing

#### Individual Operations
```lisp
; Load a file containing module definitions
(load "library/core.lisp")

; Import a module's exports into current environment
(import core)

; Use imported functions directly
(factorial 10)

; Or use qualified access without importing
(core.factorial 10)
```

#### Unified Require Function
The `require` function combines loading and importing in a single operation:

```lisp
; Basic require - load file and import all exports
(require "library/core.lisp")
(factorial 10)  ; Available immediately

; Equivalent to:
; (load "library/core.lisp")
; (import core)
```

**Benefits:**
- **Simplicity**: One command instead of two separate load/import calls
- **Efficiency**: Automatically detects and imports modules from loaded files
- **File Caching**: Prevents re-loading the same file multiple times
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for missing files or modules

**Usage Example:**
```lisp
; Traditional approach
(load "library/functional.lisp")
(import functional)
(map (fn (x) (* x 2)) (list 1 2 3))

; Simplified with require  
(require "library/functional.lisp")
(map (fn (x) (* x 2)) (list 1 2 3))
```

**Current Implementation:**
- Supports basic `(require "filename")` syntax
- Automatically loads file and imports all module exports
- Prevents duplicate file loading through caching
- Works with all existing library modules (core, functional, strings, macros)

### Access Patterns

#### Qualified Access
```lisp
; Access without importing
(math-utils.square 5)      ; => 25
(core.factorial 10)        ; => 3628800
```

#### Direct Access After Import
```lisp
(import math-utils)
(square 5)                 ; => 25
(add-squares 3 4)         ; => 25
```

#### Module Introspection
```lisp
(modules)                  ; List all loaded modules
(env)                      ; View current environment bindings
```

### File Organization
- **Library Structure**: Organize related functions into modules within files
- **Export Control**: Only exported functions are accessible outside the module
- **Private Functions**: Non-exported functions remain module-internal
- **Dependency Management**: Files can load other files, creating dependency chains

## Big Number Support

The interpreter provides comprehensive support for arbitrary precision arithmetic:

### Automatic Precision Detection
- Large integers (â‰¥ 10^15) are automatically handled as big numbers during parsing
- Arithmetic operations detect potential overflow and promote results to big numbers
- Seamless mixing of regular numbers and big numbers in expressions

### Readable Formatting
- Big numbers display in standard decimal format without separators
- Example: `1000000000000000000000` displays as `1000000000000000000000`

### Operations Support
- All arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- All comparison operations: `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Compatible with tail-recursive algorithms for computing large factorials and Fibonacci numbers

### Examples
```lisp
; Large multiplication automatically uses big numbers
(* 1000000000000000 1000000000000000)
=> 1000000000000000000000000000000

; Factorial of large numbers
(defn factorial [n acc]
  (if (= n 0) acc (factorial (- n 1) (* n acc))))

(factorial 50 1)
=> 30414093201713378043612608166064768844377641568960512000000000000

; Comparisons work seamlessly
(> 1000000000000000000000 999999999999999999999)
=> #t
```

## Macro System

The interpreter includes a powerful macro system that enables code transformation at evaluation time, allowing developers to extend the language with custom syntax and control structures.

### Macro Definition
- `(defmacro name [params] body)` - Define a macro that transforms code before evaluation
- Macros receive unevaluated arguments and return code to be evaluated
- Macro expansion happens at evaluation time, not parse time

### Quote Special Form  
- `(quote expr)` or `'expr` - Return expression without evaluating it
- Essential for macro programming to manipulate code as data
- Both long form `(quote ...)` and shorthand `'...` syntax supported

### Examples
```lisp
; Define a 'when' control structure
(defmacro when [condition body]
  (list 'if condition body 'nil))

; Use the when macro
(when (> x 5) (print! "x is greater than 5"))
; Expands to: (if (> x 5) (print! "x is greater than 5") nil)

; Define an 'unless' macro
(defmacro unless [condition then else]
  (list 'if condition else then))

(unless (< x 5) "not less" "is less")
; Expands to: (if (< x 5) "is less" "not less")

; Quote prevents evaluation
(quote (+ 1 2))    ; => (+ 1 2)
'(+ 1 2)           ; => (+ 1 2) 
(+ 1 2)            ; => 3

; Complex macro - let-like binding
(defmacro let1 [var value body]
  (list (list 'lambda (list var) body) value))

(let1 x 10 (+ x 5))  ; => 15
; Expands to: ((fn [x] (+ x 5)) 10)
```

### Macro Benefits
- **Language Extension**: Create new control structures and syntax
- **Code Generation**: Automatically generate repetitive code patterns  
- **DSL Creation**: Build domain-specific languages within Lisp
- **Performance**: Code transformation happens at evaluation time, not runtime

## Atom System (Thread-safe Mutable State)

The interpreter provides Clojure-style atoms for managing mutable state in a thread-safe manner. Atoms offer atomic, synchronous access to a single piece of data using software transactional memory principles.

### Core Atom Operations

#### Atom Creation
- `(atom value)` - Create a new atom with an initial value
- Atoms can hold any data type: numbers, strings, lists, hash maps, etc.
- Each atom is an independent mutable reference

#### Value Access
- `(deref atom)` - Get the current value of an atom
- Dereferencing is always atomic and returns the current state
- Non-blocking read operation

#### Atomic Updates
- `(swap! atom function)` - Apply a function to the current value atomically
- The function receives the current value and returns the new value
- If another thread modifies the atom during the swap, the operation retries
- `(reset! atom new-value)` - Set the atom to a completely new value atomically

### Thread Safety

Atoms use Go mutexes internally to ensure thread-safe access:
- **Atomic Reads**: `deref` operations are guaranteed to see consistent state
- **Atomic Writes**: `swap!` and `reset!` operations are serialized and atomic
- **Consistency**: No torn reads or partial updates possible
- **Performance**: Optimized for high-concurrency scenarios

### Examples

```lisp
; Basic atom usage
(def counter (atom 0))
(deref counter)                    ; => 0

; Atomic increment
(swap! counter (fn [x] (+ x 1)))
(deref counter)                    ; => 1

; Direct reset
(reset! counter 100)
(deref counter)                    ; => 100

; Atoms with complex data
(def person (atom {:name "Alice" :age 30}))
(swap! person (fn [p] (hash-map-put p :age 31)))
(deref person)                     ; => {:name "Alice" :age 31}

; Safe concurrent updates
(def shared-state (atom (list)))
(defn add-item [item]
  (swap! shared-state (fn [lst] (cons item lst))))

(add-item "first")
(add-item "second")
(deref shared-state)               ; => ("second" "first")
```

### Use Cases

- **Counters**: Thread-safe incrementing/decrementing
- **Caches**: Atomic cache updates and invalidation  
- **State Management**: Application state in concurrent environments
- **Configuration**: Runtime configuration updates
- **Statistics**: Collecting metrics atomically

### Best Practices

- Use atoms for coordinated state that needs thread safety
- Keep atom update functions pure and side-effect free
- Minimize the scope of data protected by atoms
- Consider using multiple atoms instead of one large atom for better concurrency
- Use `swap!` for transformations, `reset!` for complete replacement

## Do Construct (Sequential Evaluation)

The `do` construct allows evaluating multiple expressions in sequence and returns the result of the last expression. This is essential for executing side effects and performing multiple operations in order.

### Syntax
- `(do expr1 expr2 ... exprN)` - Evaluate expressions in order, return the last result
- If no expressions are provided, returns `nil`
- Each expression is evaluated in the current environment

### Examples

```lisp
; Simple sequential operations
(do 
  (def x 5)
  (def y 10)
  (+ x y))                         ; => 15

; With side effects
(do
  (println! "Starting computation...")
  (def result (* 6 7))
  (println! "Computation complete!")
  result)                          ; => 42

; Empty do returns nil
(do)                               ; => nil

; Single expression (equivalent to direct evaluation)
(do (+ 2 3))                       ; => 5
```

### Use Cases

- **Initialization**: Setting up multiple variables in sequence
- **Side Effects**: Performing print statements, file operations, etc.
- **Function Bodies**: Multiple statements in lambda functions
- **State Changes**: Sequential atom updates or other mutations
- **Control Flow**: Building blocks for complex control structures

## Concurrency with Goroutines

The interpreter provides comprehensive concurrency support through goroutines and channels, enabling parallel execution and communication between concurrent tasks.

### Goroutines (Async Execution)

#### Basic Goroutine Operations
- `(go expression)` - Start a new goroutine to evaluate an expression asynchronously
- `(go-wait future)` - Wait for a single goroutine to complete and return its result
- `(go-wait-all futures)` - Wait for multiple goroutines to complete and return all results

#### Future Objects
- Goroutines return future objects that represent pending computations
- Futures are thread-safe and can be waited on multiple times
- Error handling is built-in - panics in goroutines are captured as errors

### Examples

```lisp
; Simple goroutine
(def square-future (go (* 5 5)))
(println! "Goroutine started...")
(println! "Result:" (go-wait square-future))  ; => Result: 25

; Multiple goroutines
(def futures (list
  (go (+ 1 2 3))
  (go (* 4 5))
  (go (- 10 3))))

(def results (go-wait-all futures))
(println! "Results:" results)                 ; => Results: (6 20 7)

; Goroutines with shared state (atoms)
(def counter (atom 0))

(def increment-futures (list
  (go (swap! counter (fn [x] (+ x 1))))
  (go (swap! counter (fn [x] (+ x 1))))
  (go (swap! counter (fn [x] (+ x 1))))))

(go-wait-all increment-futures)
(println! "Counter:" (deref counter))         ; => Counter: 3
```

### Channels (Communication)

#### Channel Operations  
- `(chan)` - Create an unbuffered channel
- `(chan size)` - Create a buffered channel with specified capacity
- `(chan-send! channel value)` - Send a value to a channel (blocks if full)
- `(chan-recv! channel)` - Receive a value from a channel (blocks if empty)
- `(chan-close! channel)` - Close a channel

#### Producer-Consumer Pattern
```lisp
; Create a buffered channel
(def data-chan (chan 5))

; Producer goroutine
(def producer (go 
  (do
    (chan-send! data-chan "Hello")
    (chan-send! data-chan "World")
    (chan-close! data-chan))))

; Consumer
(println! "Received:" (chan-recv! data-chan))  ; => Received: Hello
(println! "Received:" (chan-recv! data-chan))  ; => Received: World

(go-wait producer)  ; Wait for producer to finish
```

### Thread Safety and Environment Isolation

- **Isolated Environments**: Each goroutine gets its own environment that inherits from the parent
- **Variable Access**: Goroutines can read parent variables but cannot modify them directly  
- **Shared State**: Use atoms for thread-safe shared mutable state
- **Error Handling**: Panics in goroutines are captured and converted to errors
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and resource management across goroutines

### Use Cases

- **Parallel Computation**: CPU-intensive tasks that can be parallelized
- **I/O Operations**: Non-blocking file operations, network requests
- **Producer-Consumer**: Data processing pipelines with channels
- **Background Tasks**: Long-running operations that don't block the main thread
- **Event Processing**: Concurrent event handling and processing
- **Load Distribution**: Distributing work across multiple goroutines

### Best Practices

- Use goroutines for truly parallel or asynchronous work
- Communicate through channels rather than shared memory when possible
- Use atoms for simple shared state that needs atomic updates
- Always wait for goroutines to complete before program termination
- Handle errors properly by checking future results
- Keep goroutine lifetimes manageable to avoid resource leaks
